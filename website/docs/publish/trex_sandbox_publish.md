Sandboxed Extensions are Tableau dashboard extensions that are not permitted to make external network requests. Sandboxed Extensions are hosted by Tableau and run inside an environment that prevents communication with anything except the Tableau hosting server. Sandboxed Extensions are supported in Tableau 2019.4 and later.

## Before publishing your extension

Be sure to follow the guidelines and requirements to [Create and Test Sandboxed Extensions](../security/trex_sandbox_test). Make sure your extension works as expected in the development environment. The development environment replicates the Tableau Sandboxed Extension Hosting Cloud Service. If your extension works in the development environment, it will work when you submit the extension package to Tableau for publication.


## Submit your Sandboxed Extension for publication

After you finish developing and testing your Sandboxed Extension, you can submit your extension to the Tableau Exchange. To submit your extension to the Tableau Exchange, you must be added as a contributor on the Exchange. Contact the Tableau Exchange at [extensiongallery@tableau.com](mailto:extensiongallery@tableau.com) and see [Submitting your Extension to the Tableau Exchange](../ux_extension_gallery.md) for more information.
